## Planned features
- Switch over to [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/app/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) for testing and add more tests.
- Compare data between users. (Only after users have been downloaded)
- Graphs showing data (like difficulty jumps or similar)
- Rework of major components to use web components?
- Get more data from github instead of having to update 2 repos when 1 thing changes.
- Improved filter system (with more options as to how to show data)
- Default / saved settings
- "me" user (just a quick button to load our data)
- Better way of showing which badges are obtainable and which are not.
- Have towers sorted (locally) instead of relying on the server.
- Fully functional offline mode
