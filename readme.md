# EToH TT Data Branch
Welcome to the Data branch of my EToH Tower Tracker.

## Purpose of this branch
Cleaner and easier access to any tower data. Also fully automated so that the data section rarley has to be touched (Thanks EToH WIKI Community)

## Why A separate branch?
Multiple benefits:
- It's easier for github actions
  Also means that they are out of the way and don't have any chance to break anything (not that they should). But getting an action to push to main is a bit annoying sometimes.
- Cleaner
  Although we could put everything in a folder, it's still a folder which rarley gets touched. So just tidies it up a bit

## Lastly
This branch is not designed to be pushed into main. This will run alongside main, hence why we branched off at root (`000000`) instead of latest commit (`be0772cd` at time of split)
